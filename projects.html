      <h2>End of support for myOS 1</h2>
      <p>myOS 1 support ended on November 10, 2024. myOS 1 users should migrate to myOS 2, ScratchOS 1 or myOS 4 Alphas <a href="https://github.com/OS-Scratch/myOS-4/releases" class="link">(once available)</a></p>
      <br />
      <h2>Information for myOS 3</h2>
      <p>Sadly, myOS 3 is not being developed any more. <br> <b>Why's that?</b> The project was too big and was constantly crashing, disabling me to save my work. myOS 4.0 RC will be released soon (planned on March 2025).</p>
      <h2>myOS 4.0: The future is here.</h2>
      <p>myOS 4.0 is coming! The brand-new release with a file system, smart assistant, App Hub, native terminal and more.</p>
