# georgek0's website
Welcome to georgek0's website, developer of the myOS 1, 2, 3 and ScratchOS 1 operating systems on Scratch.
## About
I develop operating systems on Scratch as a hobby. I got the idea for this while using my computer. I found it hard, to find a specific function and thought that it would be fun to create one myself. Meanwhile, the projects have gotten over 100 views on Scratch and 8 likes and favorites total. 
## myOS 3
myOS 3 is still in development. Check back soon for more information about its current development state!
View all progress on https://github.com/OS-Scratch/myOS-3.
